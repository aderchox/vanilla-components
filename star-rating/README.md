Specifications:
- 5 stars
- each star is either empty or filled completely (half stars not supported yet)
- on hover stars become filled from the first one to the star hovered
- when not hovered, stars become filled from the first one to the star specified by the value of the rating
- when clicking after hover, the value and the filled stars must change accordingly
- the rating must be lockable, so that neither hovering nor clicking on it will have an effect
- three types of star-rating must be available, sticky, normal (non-sticky, default), and readonly. sticky means once the rating is done by the user, it won't be changeable. (Note that it still requires backend validation as well obviously if this is a strict requirement.)
